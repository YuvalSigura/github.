## Introduction

This project is designed to highlight my expertise in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and AI through an interactive 3D experience. It features a dynamic 3D scene with models, animations, and user interactions.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models**: Explore various 3D models that represent my projects and skills.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Watch animations that demonstrate key aspects of my expertise.
- **User Interaction**: Engage with the 3D environment through mouse movements and clicks.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://yourusername.github.io/my-portfolio-website).

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-portfolio-website.git
   cd my-portfolio-website
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The website should now be running on [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can:

- **Explore the 3D environment**: Use your mouse to navigate through the scene.
- **Interact with models**: Click on various models to trigger animations or display additional information.
